# lttng-utils

This repository contains helper scripts to record traces with LTTng for many common use cases.

### Requirements

This scripts requires the following packages to run:

  * [LTTng](http://lttng.org)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org) >= 3.4
  * [PyYaml](http://pyyaml.org) often available in distros as ``python3-yaml`` or ``python-yaml``
  * [Setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) (for installation, not needed if running from directory)

### Install

#### Install from source

To install the helper script and profiles from the source

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. run the setup script from the project's root directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tahini/lttng-utils.git
$ cd lttng-utils
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

#### Install from the Git repository

To install LTTng utils directly from the git repository

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Make sure ``pip`` for Python 3 is installed on your system. The package is named ``python3-pip`` on most distributions
   (``python-pip`` on Arch Linux).
3. Use ``pip3`` to install LTTng analyses:

```
$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/tahini/lttng-utils.git@master
```

### Usage

To simply record a trace with common kernel events that can then be analyzed with most of the analyses in [lttng-analyses](https://github.com/lttng/lttng-analyses) or opened in [Trace Compass](http://tracecompass.org), use the following command: Tracing can be stopped by pressing ctrl-c.

```
$ lttng-record-trace
```

To trace only during a specific application's lifetime, just add the application to trace to the arguments of the commands, for example, to trace only the ``ls -alt`` command

```
$ lttng-record-trace ls -alt
```

More options are available for tracing. See the helper

```
$ lttng-record-trace --help
```

### Profiles

LTTng-utils comes with a set of pre-defined profiles for common tracing use cases. Users can define their own profiles as well. The ``lttng-record-trace --list-profiles`` command will show the paths that are searched for profile, typically, the builtin script's path, ``$HOME/.lttng-utils/profiles/`` and a ``profiles/`` directory in the current directory.

Here is the output of the ``lttng-record-trace --list-profiles`` command for the builtin profiles:

```
Available profiles:

       timer          The kernel timer events  
       network        The kernel network events
       sched          The scheduler events of the kernel
       mm             The page allocation events of the kernel (they are very numerous)
       kernel         A subset of kernel events sufficient and necessary to make most Trace Compass analyses
                      Includes profiles: sched, interrupt, network, timer, statedump_k, disk
       cyg_profile    Enable function entry and exit tracepoints for a -finstrument-functions compiled application
       statedump_k    The lttng kernel statedump events
       interrupt      The kernel events for interrupts and software interrupts
       disk           The kernel events for disk analysis
       libc           Enable the lttng UST libc wrapper
       cyg_profile_fast Enable fast function entry and exit tracepoints for a -finstrument-functions compiled application
```

For example, to test an application instrumented with the ``-finstrument-functions`` compiler flag, you can run ``lttng-record-trace -p cyg_profile ./myapp`` or ``lttng-record-trace -p cyg-profile,kernel ./myapp`` to trace the system along with the application.

To add your own profile, you can create a new file named ``myprofile.profile`` in one of those directory mentioned above and edit it. Profiles are yaml files with the following structure:

```
desc:
    A description of the profile that will appear when listing profiles
includes:
    list of profiles to include in this one
kernel:
    list of kernel events to enable, 'syscall' being a special event to enable all syscalls
ust:
    list of userspace events to enable
jul:
    list of JUL events to enable
preload:
    list of libraries to preload when running the application to trace
```

Then you can run the trace recording script with the profile like this:

```
$ lttng-record-trace -p myprofile
```
